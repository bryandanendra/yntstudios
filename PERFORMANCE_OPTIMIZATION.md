# Performance Optimization Guide

## ‚úÖ Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**
- ‚úÖ All pages now use `React.lazy()` for code splitting
- ‚úÖ Suspense boundaries added for better loading states
- ‚úÖ Reduces initial bundle size significantly

### 2. **Prism Component (WebGL) Optimization**
- ‚úÖ Reduced shader iterations from 100 to 60 steps (40% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Lower DPR (Device Pixel Ratio) on mobile: 1 instead of 2
- ‚úÖ Delayed rendering by 100ms to improve initial page load
- ‚úÖ `suspendWhenOffscreen={true}` to pause rendering when not visible

### 3. **ModelViewer (Three.js) Optimization**
- ‚úÖ Lazy loaded with Suspense
- ‚úÖ Disabled shadows on mobile devices
- ‚úÖ Disabled antialiasing on mobile
- ‚úÖ Disabled Environment preset on mobile
- ‚úÖ Disabled ContactShadows on mobile
- ‚úÖ Set `powerPreference: 'low-power'` on mobile
- ‚úÖ Reduced pixel ratio to max 1.5 on mobile

### 4. **Video Loading Optimization**
- ‚úÖ Lazy load video using IntersectionObserver
- ‚úÖ Only loads when section is in viewport
- ‚úÖ Added `preload="metadata"` to reduce initial load

### 5. **General Best Practices**
- ‚úÖ `frameloop="demand"` on Canvas (only renders when needed)
- ‚úÖ Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- ‚úÖ Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies

## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- All 6 pages loaded immediately
- Heavy WebGL shaders running at full quality
- 3D models with full shadows/effects on mobile
- Video auto-loaded on page load
- **Estimated Initial Load: 3-5 seconds on mobile**

### After Optimization:
- Pages load on-demand (code splitting)
- Reduced shader complexity (40% less iterations)
- Mobile-optimized 3D rendering
- Video loads only when visible
- **Estimated Initial Load: 1-2 seconds on mobile**

## üöÄ Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Image Optimization**
```bash
# Install sharp for image optimization
npm install sharp

# Optimize images in /public/images
# Convert to WebP format for better compression
```

### 2. **Bundle Analysis**
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer

# Add to package.json scripts:
"analyze": "source-map-explorer 'build/static/js/*.js'"
```

### 3. **Service Worker for Caching**
```bash
# Enable service worker in src/index.js
# Change: serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()
# To: serviceWorkerRegistration.register()
```

### 4. **Compression on Vercel**
Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. **Preload Critical Resources**
Add to `public/index.html`:
```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.sanity.io">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com">
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org">
```

## üîç Performance Monitoring

### Test Performance:
```bash
# Build production version
npm run build

# Serve locally
npx serve -s build

# Test with Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
# Target scores:
# - Performance: 80+
# - Accessibility: 90+
# - Best Practices: 90+
# - SEO: 90+
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: < 1.8s
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **TBT (Total Blocking Time)**: < 200ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

## üì± Mobile-Specific Optimizations

### Implemented:
1. Reduced WebGL quality (lower DPR, fewer iterations)
2. Disabled expensive 3D effects (shadows, environment maps)
3. Lower power consumption mode for GPU
4. Lazy loading for heavy components

### Testing on Mobile:
1. Use Chrome DevTools Device Mode
2. Throttle CPU (4x slowdown)
3. Throttle Network (Fast 3G)
4. Test on real devices if possible

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Trade-offs

1. **Visual Quality on Mobile**: Slightly reduced quality for better performance
2. **Loading States**: Users see "Loading..." briefly between sections
3. **Initial Render**: Prism has 100ms delay before appearing

These trade-offs are acceptable for significantly better performance on mobile devices.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If still slow:
1. Check Network tab for large assets
2. Use React DevTools Profiler to find slow components
3. Consider removing Prism component entirely on mobile
4. Use static images instead of 3D models on mobile
5. Implement progressive loading for images

### Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## üìà Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test on real mobile devices
2. ‚úÖ Run Lighthouse audit
3. ‚úÖ Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
4. Consider implementing:
   - Image lazy loading library (react-lazy-load-image-component)
   - Virtual scrolling for long lists
   - Memoization for expensive calculations
   - Web Workers for heavy computations
